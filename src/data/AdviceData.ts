    advice:
      "I know is old folk aren't as smart as we like to think we are, but when it comes to finance, money, investing and everything in between the majority of us have learnt a thing or two over the years (usually from our mistakes). So speak to your parents about money. Parents love giving advice, so use that to your advantage here.",
    parents:
      "Encourage your kids to talk about money and be receptive if they broach the subject with you. You don't have to go into the ins and outs of your finances. Just talk about saving, budgeting, credit scores etc",

    heading: "Compound interest is a thing - Start early",
    advice:
      "The sooner you start saving, investing or anything really the better. What seems like very little in the short term can equate to a tidy sum of money in the long term. Read up on compound interest and let your money work for you.",

    heading: "Credit - The good, The Bad & The ugly",
    advice:
      "Credit is something young people are often steered away from, which is not terrible advice. If you don't borrow you can't get into trouble. However it is also true that credit makes the world go round. Want to buy a house? You'll need good credit, want to buy a car? - ditto. Building up a strong credit score is vital to leverage the most competitive rates when you do need to borrow. So don't shy away from credit when the time comes. Start small, make sure it is affordable and watch your score shoot up.",

    heading: "Budgeting",
    advice:
      "If you want to stay on top of your finances budgeting is a must. How do you know you are overreaching if you don't know your outgoings? the answer is you don't. A really simple budget of income and expenditure is an amazing tool, which can then highlight areas to cut back, room for savings and much more.",

      "Show your kids your budget and help them create one of their own. Some financial incentive or £££ matched could work wonders here.",

    heading: "Pensions",
    advice:
      "Do you really want to be working every day when you're 80/90/100 years old? Nah, I didn't think so. Planning for retirement seems boring and unnecessary when you're just a nipper, but like most things in the financial world the sooner you start the better. Remember our old friend compound interest? Well he comes into play again here, the earlier you are saving the more your interest will build. Employees and the government will also likely match a % of your salary - aka FREE MONEY - so get on that ASAP.",

      "Show your kids your pension pot, so they can see how it grows over the years. Get them an appointment with a financial advisor/bank to introduce them to the various options they have available.",

    heading: "Investing - You are not Warren Buffet...",
    advice:
      "Investing is like the wild west, picking out unique stocks and watching your money 100x is a pipe dream. Can it be done? Sure, with a shit load of research and knowledge, but the reality is not many of us have those skills. Still want to invest? Great, look into index funds, over the long term they almost always show a decent return, beating the interest rate and there are many places you can now start investing with super small amounts with little to no fees",
    parents:
      "Investing can very quickly become gambling, if your kids come to you talking about investing their money that is a good thing. However be sure to talk to them about risk, being in it for the long term and help them get solid advice.",

    heading: "You need an emergency fund",
    advice:
      "Before looking to invest your hard earned cash or splash out on any luxury purchases you should build an emergency fund, which is a pot of money that you aim not to spend unless you have to. A good rule of thumb to aim for is 1 months wages or a couple of months of expenses. This can bail you out for things like care repairs or any other unexpected expense that isn't in your budget. Just remember to replenish it when you do have to dip into it.",

    heading: "Track your spending",
    advice:
      "Money, cash especially is so easy to spend. If you're not careful you will just blast through all of your funds and be left short on pay day. A great way to review your spending habits and prepare for budget planning is to track your spending. This can be done in many ways, write stuff down on pen and paper, notes app on your phone or a more sophisticated app - the choice is yours.",

    heading: "Beware of the minimum payment trap",
    advice:
      "At some point you will look to get a credit card to increase your credit rating and build a nice profile. This is smart. However be aware then when your statement comes in that the minimum payment is almost entirely just the interest incurred. In other words you are paying a fee for the borrowing but not reducing your debt much at all. This is bad. Pro tip, take out a credit card, pay for your shopping, petrol, mobile or whatever each month and clear the entire balance every month. This way you are building upi your credit score without paying a penny in interest - win win.",

    id: uuidv4(),
    heading: "Don't live beyond your means",
    advice:
      "You may well have built up a half decent credit score and now have lots of options for borrowing, you see a nice car you want and buy it when you can't really afford the payments. Now I don't mean you literally can't afford it, that would just be silly (don't do that)! But just because you have the money for the monthly payments doesn't mean you can afford it. You may have to sacrifice topping up your emergency fund, scaling back on savings and/or investments etc. This is not smart and will cost you a lot in the long term.",
