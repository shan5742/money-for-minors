# Money for Minors

Money for minors is a simple information website aimed at informing young people about finance and money management. This is **NOT** a financial advice website in the sense of offering investment opportunities/products or anythign like that. We are absolutely not qualified to do that.

It is more just general tips about money in the hopes that people find it useful and then go on to do further learning and exploration on their own.
